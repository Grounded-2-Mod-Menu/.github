## Product Description

Meet the **Legit Mod Menu Pack**: a stack of **in-game options, HUD trims, GPU/monitor filters, audio EQ, custom difficulty presets, bind layouts, and base/route templates** that acts like your personal control hub. Instead of clicking a shady menu mid-game, you‚Äôll **swap profiles on the fly**, flip info density up or down, and keep your picture crispy‚Äîso insects, loot nodes, and lanes are easy reads. It‚Äôs the same end goal as a mod menu (more control, less chaos), done the right way.

## Installation Instructions ‚Äî Build Your Legit ‚ÄúMod Menu‚Äù üõ†Ô∏è

1. **Create Profile Presets**

   * **Day:** Normal brightness, light sharpen, standard minimap.
   * **Night:** +10‚Äì15% brightness, a hair more sharpen, larger minimap.
   * **Boss:** Slightly reduced effects, crisp audio mids, HUD simplified to essentials.

2. **Video & Visual Clarity**

   * **Off:** Motion Blur, Film Grain, heavy Chromatic Aberration, Vignette.
   * **Anti-Aliasing:** Choose a balanced mode; avoid super-soft AA that smears foliage detail.
   * **Sharpen:** Light to moderate‚Äîedges defined, no halos.
   * **FOV:** Raise until flanks are comfy to track; keep aim/ADS rules consistent so scope transitions feel 1:1.

3. **GPU/Monitor Filters (subtle > extreme)**

   * Add **moderate vibrance** and a touch of **contrast** so creatures and loot gleam separate from the biome.
   * If you have game filters, test a gentle **clarity + contrast + slight exposure** combo on mixed lighting maps (sun, shade, water).

4. **HUD & Minimap Trim**

   * Increase minimap **size** and set a **zoom** that catches patrol routes without flooding your screen.
   * Use **high-contrast markers** for labs, sap taps, fiber loops, boss prep base, and safety shelters.
   * Keep crosshair simple; busy reticles hide headboxes in particles.

5. **Audio Imaging (your legal wall-sense)**

   * Footstep-forward EQ: reduce muddy lows, preserve mids where steps, wing beats, and chew clicks live.
   * Avoid heavy dynamic compression that buries distant cues; test near water and tall grass to tune reverb.

6. **Bind Logic & Inventory Flow**

   * **Hotbar lanes:** 1) melee, 2) ranged, 3) block/parry, 4) heal, 5) throwable, 6) light, 7) build tool, 8‚Äì10) situational.
   * Pin **favorite recipes** (bandages, arrows, repair glue) and keep mats in the same chests for muscle memory.
   * Practice a **panic key** combo (heal ‚Üí block ‚Üí rotate) until it‚Äôs automatic.

7. **Custom Difficulty Presets**

   * **Practice:** Slightly lower creature damage and stamina drain to learn perfect blocks, kite timings, and swap rhythm.
   * **Adventure:** Restore defaults for real runs once your timings are clean.

8. **Build & Route Templates**

   * **Triangle base network:** main hub + two minis to cover sap, water, and a lab path.
   * **Ziplines:** Prioritize uphill return lines so hauls are safe and quick.
   * **Lamps at chokepoints:** Light tall grass corridors to stop night patrol jump-scares.
   * Drop **temporary markers** when diving deep; pull them on the way back to keep the map tidy.

* **Minimap Zoom Bind:** Quick tap cycles between scout, fight, and travel zoom levels.
* **Profile Switcher:** One key for Day/Night/Boss‚Äîno menu hunting mid-fight.
* **Audio Focus Mode:** A toggle that slightly lowers ambience during intense fights so footsteps and reloads cut through.
* **Effect Throttle:** If sparks/webbing clutter visibility, your Boss profile already has toned-down effects‚Äîswap instantly.
* **Screenshot Clean Mode:** Hide non-essentials for captures; bring HUD back with one tap.
